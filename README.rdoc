= Serve - Delicious ERB, Haml, and Sass

link:../../downloads/jlong/serve/logo-hifi-3.png

Serve is a small Rack-based web server that makes it easy to serve HTML, ERB,
Haml, or a variety of template languages from any directory.

Serve is meant to be a lightweight version of the Views part of the Rails MVC.
This makes Serve an ideal framework for prototyping Rails applications or
creating simple websites. Serve has full support for Rails-style partials
and layouts.

Serve is made with Rack & Tilt.


== Installation

Serve is distributed as a Ruby gem and can be installed from the command
prompt. Just type:

  gem install serve

Some systems, like the Mac, may require that you type:

  sudo gem install serve

If you are new to the command prompt and are a Mac user see:

Search Google for "command prompt windows" if you are on a PC to find a simple
tutorial.


== Basic Usage

Once the gem is installed the `serve` command will be available from the
command prompt. To launch Serve, just type the command and press enter:

  serve

This will launch a simple web server which you can access from any web browser
at the following address:

  http://localhost:4000

Once the server is going it will output a running log of its activity. To
stop the server at any time, type CTRL+C at the command prompt.

== Creating a Structured Serve Project

For simple projects, you don't need to structure your files in a specific
way. All ERB, Haml, and Sass files will be processed wherever they are found
in the project root. But for more complex projects you may want add a bit of structure.

To create a structured Serve project in the "project" directory, type the
following on the command line:

  serve create project   # create a new project in the project directory

== Layouts & Partials

Serve has full support for Rails-style layouts and partials.

Serve layouts are stored in "_layout.erb" or "_layout.haml" files in the same directory as the page they are rendering.

Serve partials (much like PHP includes) are rendered using the familiar render syntax:

  <%= render "footer" %>

== View Helpers

If you drop a file called "view_helpers.rb" in your views directory, you can
define custom helpers for your Haml and ERB views. Just create a ViewHelpers
module and define your custom helper methods there:

  module ViewHelpers
    
    # Calculate the years for a copyright
    def copyright_years(start_year)
      end_year = Date.today.year
      if start_year == end_year
        start_year
      else
        start_year.to_s + "&#8211;" + end_year.to_s
      end
    end
    
  end

You can then use your custom helper methods inside a view or layout:

  <%= copyright_years(2010) %>

Serve also provides a number of stock helpers methods that are very similar to their Rails counter parts.

== Exporting

To export your project, use the new "export" command:

  serve export project output

Where "project" is the path to the project and "output" is the path to the
directory where you would like your HTML and CSS generated.

== "Design First" Prototyping

If you use a "Design First" methodology, you may find Serve especially useful
for prototyping your applications. Create a separate "prototype" project for
your application (using Serve) and copy views over into actual application
when they are ready to go. This workflow allows the designer to focus on
presentation and flow, while the developer can focuses on implementation. One
benefit to this approach is that the designer can identify and fix a large
number of design-related problems before a feature is ever touched by the
developer. Once a feature has been completed in the prototype project it can
also be estimated with a high degree of accuracy.
